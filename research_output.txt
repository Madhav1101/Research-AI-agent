Topic:
Digital Rights Management (DRM) and Copyright Protection

Summary:
Digital rights management (DRM) is the management of legal access to digital
content. Various tools or technological protection measures, such as access
control technologies, can restrict the use of proprietary hardware and
copyrighted works. DRM technologies govern the use, modification and
distribution of copyrighted works (e.g. software, multimedia content) and of
systems that enforce these policies within devices. DRM technologies include
licensing agreements and encryption. Laws in many countries criminalize the
circumvention of DRM, communication about such circumvention, and the creation
and distribution of circumvention tools.
